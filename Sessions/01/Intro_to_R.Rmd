Reading function documentation

## Basic variable types 

"=" or "<-" is an assignment operator

### String 

```{r}
my_name <- "Matt" 
```

### Numeric

```{r}
count = 10 
```

### Boolean 

```{r}
bool = TRUE

bool = FALSE
```

### Factors. In R, factors are used to work with categorical variables, variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values. They are also useful when you want to display character vectors in a non-alphabetical order (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html#:~:text=In%20R%2C%20factors%20are%20used,to%20work%20with%20than%20characters)

```{r}
months <- c("Dec", "Apr", "Jan", "Mar")

sort(months)

months_factor = factor(months, level = c("Jan", "Mar", "Apr", "Dec"))

sort(months_factor)
```

As you can see, you can join multiple variables by using c(var1, var2)

### Use the following to check the type of variable, e.g trying to add up variables that are not of the same class may not work

```{r}
class(variable)
```

## Functions for today

### sort() and class() from examples above are functions. Functions are sets of statements that are designed to perform a specific task (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/r_functions.htm). Functions have arguments, which the user can pass to them. In R, there are a lot of in-built functions. Some examples of in-built fuctions include mean(), max(), sum(), min() (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/r_functions.htm). Also, in R users can define their own functions, but we won't go over this in this session. 

```{r}
numbers = c(1,2,3,4,5)
min(numbers)
max(numbers)
sum(numbers)
mean(numbers)
```

## It's impossible (and not necessary) to know all the functions and/or their arguments. 

```{r}
help(min)
help(max)
help(sum)
help(mean)
```

# Activity one 

Create a new Rmd file and name it "Activity_1.Rmd" 

Create two numerical variables containing numbers 5 and 10. 

+, -, /, and * work like regular arithmetic operators in R. Add your two numerical variables together. 

Create two character variables containing values "5" and "10", respectively. Make sure to wrap the variables in quotes. -- check very well 

This time, multiply your two character variables together, observe the error message. 

Using help(as.numeric), try to fix the error message. 

Create a set of factor variables containing the following values: days of the week  , Specify the correct order. 

Use sort() function to make sure everything worked. 


# Part 2 

## Data are usually available to us in form of larger files, i.e. not single variables. There are functions in R that enable us to read in files. 

### read.delim()

# Consider changing the dataset then, add more data to it. 

```{r readAfile}
westernQuant <- read.delim("intro_to_R_2022/westernQuant.txt", header = TRUE)
```

### Another useful function is read.csv()

```{r}
data = read.csv("filepath.csv", header = TRUE)
```

-- Not sure how to tie together the reading in a file and using the in-built mtcars dataset. -- One thought -- save the mtcars dataset as a .delim file and replace some of the values with NAs to incorporate Matt's idea to show that functions won't work on NA-containing data

### Mtcars is a data frame (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/r_data_frames.htm)

A data frame is a table or a two-dimensional array-like structure in which each column contains values of one variable and each row contains one set of values from each column.

The following are the characteristics of a data frame.

The column names should be non-empty.
The row names should be unique.
The data stored in a data frame can be of numeric, factor or character type.
Each column should contain same number of data items.

Similar to an Excel sheet, where we have a table 

## Once we read in the file, we can manipulate the data it contains. 

### Accessing values in a column 

```{r}
mtcars$cyl
```

### Subsetting a data.frame with [ ]
data_frame[row(s), column(s)]
  empty means everything

```{r}
# first row, first column (just one element)
mtcars[1, 1]
# First row, all columns
mtcars[1, ]
# First column, all rows
mtcars[, 1]
mtcars$mpg
# First ten rows, all columns
mtcars[c(1:10), ]
```

### We can also use functions to manipulate the data

### summary()

```{r summary}
summary(mtcars)
```

### We can use the functions from the previous section

```{r}
min(mtcars$cyl)

max(mtcars$mpg)

mean(mtcars$disp)
```

-- make a column in dataset that includes NAs
---------------------------
Many of these functions can get angry about missing data (`NA`).

Include na.rm = TRUE as an argument to ignore missing data

#### This doesn't work
```{r dontruns, eval=FALSE}
mean(c(1, 3, 4, NA, 34))
```

#### This works
```{r runs}
mean(c(1, 3, 4, NA, 34), na.rm = TRUE)
```
----------------------------


### We can use fnnction to make visualizations, e.g. plot()

```{r plot}
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl)

plot(as.factor(mtcars$cyl), mtcars$mpg)
```

## Other useful functions 

### cbind, rbind
attach two data.frames either side to side or top to bottom
rbind will arrange column names
cbind just puts things together without checking order
  Generally a bad idea to cbind unless you're very careful
  
```{r}
efficient <-
  mtcars %>%
  filter(mpg > 30)

gas_guzzlers <-
  mtcars %>%
  filter(mpg < 14.5)

rbind(efficient, gas_guzzlers)

# This is total nonsense, but R does it anyways
test <- 
  cbind(efficient, gas_guzzlers)
```



## Activity 2

-- Make sure to save the summary output to a variable 

### Use read.csv to read in a 
### Read in data
Use read.delim()
```{r readData}

```

### Summarize the data.frame
Use summary()
```{r summaryWestern}

```

### Test for group differences -- use help()
Use t.test() function
```{r testDiff}

```

### Barplots
Use barplot()
```{r plots}

```

### I'm super fast
Try out wilcox.test(). --- use help() 




# Part 3

## packages -- what is a package? 
# R packages are a collection of R functions, complied code and sample data.  
#https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/r_packages.htm. Packages are usually created to address a very specific need in data analysis. 

## Tidyverse is a very useful collection of packages
#The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science (includes ggplot2, dplyr, and other ones). All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and #data structures.
#https://www.tidyverse.org/

## Include cheat sheet link

### Packages need to be installed and loaded into the session before they can be used

Some packages come from CRAN (install.packages()), Bioconductor is a BiocManager::install(), best way to find out is goodle 

```{r}
#install.packages("tidyverse", Ncpus = 8)
library(tidyverse)

# Backup plan if you run into lots of errors there...
# By the way, any text that starts with a "#" is a comment and not executed
#install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2"))
#library(dplyr)
#library(ggplot2)
```

Tidyverse packages use the pipe operator %>%

### join -- left_join, inner_join, right_join, outer_join, anti_join, by = "x" 


### mutate
Add a new column or change an existing one
```{r}
km_per_mi <- 1.60934

mtcars %>%
  mutate(kpg = mpg * km_per_mi)
```

### select
```{r}
mtcars %>%
  select(cyl)
```

### rename
```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  rename(Cyl = cyl)
```

### arrange
```{r}
mtcars %>%
  arrange(mpg)
  
head(mtcars)

tail(mtcars)

mtcars %>%
  arrange(- mpg)
  
head(mtcars)

tail(mtcars)
```

### summarize() and group_by()
group() silently divides up rows by categories
summarize() data within groups in a dataframe
Makes a new column and drops all columns not in group_by() or created by summarize()

```{r}
mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarize(mean_mpg = mean(mpg))

starwars %>%
  group_by(homeworld, species) %>%
  summarize(mean_height = mean(height),
            max_mass = max(mass))
```


### pivot_longer()
wide data vs long data
"tidy" data - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-ss_ag2k9E explanation starts ~ 6 min in
https://epirhandbook.com/en/images/pivoting/pivot_longer_new.png
```{r}
# wide data
relig_income

# long data
long_data <-
  relig_income %>%
  pivot_longer(!religion,
               names_to = "income",
               values_to = "count")

# Make it wider
wide_again <-
  long_data %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "income",
              values_from = "count")
```

### Write a table out to a text file
```{r}
write.table(wide_again,
            file = "exampleOutput.txt",
            quote = FALSE,
            sep = "\t",
            row.names = FALSE)

write_tsv(wide_again,
          file = "exampleOutputAlso.txt")
```





## Activity

### Read in and check out the Titanic data
```{r}

```

### Make variables that contain the Mean/median/min/max of age/fare
```{r}

```

### Use filter to make two new dataframe variables with just male and female only and then calculate the mean/median values for age and fare
Basically, calculate the mean/median age and fare for men vs women
```{r}

```

### Make a histogram of the age all passengers
```{r}

```

### Make another histogram for only passengers who survived

## If you're super fast

### Use `aov()` to test which factors influenced who survived the titanic disaster
```{r}

```

### Use table() to compare how many women vs men survived
```{r}

```


# 

## General stuff

### Common error messages
```{r, eval=FALSE}
mean(bob)
#Error in mean(bob) : object 'bob' not found
```
R is looking for a variable named bob, but it doesn't exist
-   Either make it
-   Check spelling/capitalization
-   You forgot to put quotes around a character string

```{r, eval=FALSE}
arbleGarble(mtcars)
#Error in arbleGarble(mtcars) : could not find function "arbleGarble"
```
R is trying to use the function `arbleGarble()`, but it doesn't exist
-   Either load in the library that has it
    -   (or use `coolLib::arbleGarble()`)
-   Check spelling/capitalization

```{r, eval=FALSE}
hist(mtcars$mpg, n = 20
# +
((((((1))))))
```
R thinks you have unfinished business here
-   Hit escape to cancel the command
-   Most likely you're missing a parenthesis or a quotation mark somewhere
-   rainbow brackets!

### googling error messages

# Part 4 

## General stuff

## GGplot

### geoms as layers
https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/

## Functions for today's activity, also for reference

### ggplot
ggplot(data_frame_here, aes(x = x_here, y = y_here, other_stuff)) +
layer_1 +
layer_2 +
layer_3 +
. +
. +
. +
modify_the_plot_somehow

#### geom_point() ##############################################################
Add a scatterplot layer to the plot
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars,
       aes(x = hp,
           y = carb)) +
  geom_point()

# Set the overall look of the plot - I like the white background better than gray
theme_set(theme_bw())
theme_update(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

ggplot(mtcars,
       aes(x = hp,
           y = carb)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()
```

#### aes(fill/color/shape/size) ################################################
Change colors/shapes/etc

If you put the argument outside of aes()

-   applies to everything in that layer
-   does not show up in the legend

If you put it inside aes()

-   Applies to parts of the layer
-   Shows up in legend

If it is in the aes() call inside of ggplot() `ggplot(aes(...))`

-   It applies to all layers
-   Unless that layer overwrites it

```{r}
mtcars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(cyl),
             y = hp)) +
  geom_boxplot(color = "red",
               fill = "blue",
               size = 4)

ggplot(mtcars,
       aes(x = hp,
           y = carb,
           color = as.factor(vs),
           shape = as.factor(gear),
           size = disp)) +
  geom_point()
```

#### geom_histogram()
Better looking than hist()
Specify how many bars to show with `bins`
```{r}
hist(storms$pressure, n = 200)

ggplot(storms,
       aes(x = pressure)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 200)
```


#### geom_col() ################################################################
Add a barplot layer to the plot
```{r}
mtcars %>%
  rownames_to_column("car_make") %>%
  mutate(car_make = str_remove(car_make," .+")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = car_make, y = hp)) +
  geom_col(color = "red") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  ggtitle("this is a title") +
  theme_update(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

mtcars %>%
  rownames_to_column("car_make") %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = car_make, x = hp)) +
  geom_col()
```

#### labs()
Add labels
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(x = hp, y = disp)) +
  labs(x = "X label goes here",
       y = "Y label goes here",
       title = "This is a title",
       subtitle = "Subtitle!",
       caption = "Cannon et al, 2034!",
       tag = "A")
```


#### theme()
A good guide to what theme elements are what:
https://henrywang.nl/ggplot2-theme-elements-demonstration/

You can change just about any aspect of how the plot looks with theme()
You'll have to look up how to change each specific bit
```{r}
ggplot(storms,
       aes(x = pressure,
           fill = category)) +
  # alpha sets transparency - 0 is clear, 1 is opaque
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  # The brewer color palettes are pretty, and "Set2" is color-blind friendly
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.2, 0.9),
        legend.direction = "horizontal",
        legend.key.width = unit(2, "cm"),
        legend.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
        strip.background = element_rect(color = "white", fill = "white"),
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 30, face = "bold"),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_blank(),
        axis.line.x = element_line(color = "black"),
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank())
```

### ggsave()
```{r}
ggsave("examplePlot.png",
       width = 10,
       height = 8)

plot_in_variable <-
  ggplot(dplyr::storms,
         aes(x = pressure)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 100) +
  facet_wrap(~ category)

# ggsave will get the plot size from how big your "plot" windows is in the right pane if you don't specify it!!!!!
ggsave("anotherExamplePlot.png",
       plot = plot_in_variable)
```

### Include pdf() and png()
